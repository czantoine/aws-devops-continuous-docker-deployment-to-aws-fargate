### Key Components for Continuous Deployment on AWS Fargate

1. **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**: 

![AWS DevOps: Continuous Docker Deployment to AWS Fargate from GitHub using Terraform](./img/img1.png)

The VPC defines an isolated network in the cloud where you can deploy your AWS resources. It's used to host your subnets, security groups, alb, and other networking resources.

2. **Subnets**: 

![AWS DevOps: Continuous Docker Deployment to AWS Fargate from GitHub using Terraform](./img/img2.png)

Subnets are logical partitions of your VPC network that can be spread across different availability zones to ensure high availability of your resources. A minimum of 2 AZ is required for alb deployment and resilient architecture.

3. **Internet Gateway**: 

![AWS DevOps: Continuous Docker Deployment to AWS Fargate from GitHub using Terraform](./img/img3.png)

The internet gateway enables your resources in the VPC to communicate with the internet.

4. **NAT Gateway**: 

![AWS DevOps: Continuous Docker Deployment to AWS Fargate from GitHub using Terraform](./img/img4.png)

The NAT Gateway allows resources in private subnets to access the internet without directly exposing those resources.

5. **Route Tables**: 

![AWS DevOps: Continuous Docker Deployment to AWS Fargate from GitHub using Terraform](./img/img5.png)

Route tables define how network traffic is directed between different resources within your VPC.

6. **Security Groups**: 

![AWS DevOps: Continuous Docker Deployment to AWS Fargate from GitHub using Terraform](./img/img6.png)

Security groups are virtual firewalls that control incoming and outgoing traffic for your instances. They act as instance-level firewalls.

7. **Elastic Container Service (ECS)**: 

![AWS DevOps: Continuous Docker Deployment to AWS Fargate from GitHub using Terraform](./img/img7.png)

ECS is a container management service that enables you to run and manage containerized applications. It offers flexible deployment options for Docker containers.

8. **ECS Cluster**: 

![AWS DevOps: Continuous Docker Deployment to AWS Fargate from GitHub using Terraform](./img/img8.png)

An ECS cluster is a group of EC2 or Fargate resources that allows you to run containerized tasks and services.

9. **Task Definition**: 

![AWS DevOps: Continuous Docker Deployment to AWS Fargate from GitHub using Terraform](./img/img9.png)

The ECS task definition is a template for defining how a containerized application should run, including Docker images, exposed ports, etc.

10. **IAM Roles and Policies**: 

IAM (Identity and Access Management) is used to manage roles and permissions. In my case, roles and policies are created to 
allow services to authenticate and access other services.

11. **CodePipeline**: 

![AWS DevOps: Continuous Docker Deployment to AWS Fargate from GitHub using Terraform](./img/img10.png)

AWS CodePipeline is a continuous deployment service that automates the process of releasing your code changes. It coordinates actions 
such as building, testing, and deploying.

![AWS DevOps: Continuous Docker Deployment to AWS Fargate from GitHub using Terraform](./img/img11.png)

12. **CodeBuild**:

![AWS DevOps: Continuous Docker Deployment to AWS Fargate from GitHub using Terraform](./img/img12.png)

AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service that compiles your code, runs tests, and produces deployable artifacts.

13. **S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service)**: 

![AWS DevOps: Continuous Docker Deployment to AWS Fargate from GitHub using Terraform](./img/img13.png)

S3 is a scalable object storage service used to store build artifacts.

14. **CloudWatch Events**: CloudWatch Events allows you to monitor and respond to changes in the state of AWS resources. In case, it's used to detect changes in CodeBuild build statuses.

15. **SNS (Simple Notification Service)**: 

![AWS DevOps: Continuous Docker Deployment to AWS Fargate from GitHub using Terraform](./img/img14.png)

Subscribers to this topic can receive notifications via email, allowing them to stay informed about the status of deployments.

16. **Load Balancer (ALB)**: 

![AWS DevOps: Continuous Docker Deployment to AWS Fargate from GitHub using Terraform](./img/img15.png)

The Application Load Balancer (ALB) distributes incoming traffic across different IPs of your application based on defined routing rules.

17. **Target Groups**: 

![AWS DevOps: Continuous Docker Deployment to AWS Fargate from GitHub using Terraform](./img/img16.png)

Target groups are used with the load balancer to direct traffic to specific instances based on defined criteria.

18. **GitHub Token**: 

![AWS DevOps: Continuous Docker Deployment to AWS Fargate from GitHub using Terraform](./img/img17.png)

GitHub token with repository access rights.

19. **To Access Application**:

- Copy and paste the Terraform deployment output in your favorite browser.

![AWS DevOps: Continuous Docker Deployment to AWS Fargate from GitHub using Terraform](./img/img18.png)

- Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 service and go on Load Balancer section. You can access the application by copy and paste the ALB DNS.
